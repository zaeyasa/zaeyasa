### Hi there, I'm Selman! 👋

I hold a **PhD in Plant Biotechnology** (Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics). Currently, I am expanding my research methodology from the wet lab to the digital realm, exploring the capabilities of **Generative AI**.

My approach to AI is driven by scientific curiosity: I view "Prompt Engineering" not just as writing commands, but as experimental optimization - similar to refining a PCR protocol or a culture medium.

🔭 **Current Focus & Experiments**
* **Bioinformatics & Data Analysis:** Applying statistical rigor to molecular data (e.g., qRT-PCR analysis, omics data) and visualizing biological data, genome-wide analyses, (some gene transfer), and combined wet-lab approaches.
* **Generative AI:** Deep diving into workflows, design, optimization, and latent space manipulation.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Exploring **local inference** (GGUF/Llama), investigating **Chain-of-Thought** prompting for complex reasoning, and utilizing LLMs to accelerate my Python learning journey.
* **Models:** Experimenting with Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion 1.5, 2, XL, 3.5, Flux1&2) and LLMs.
* **Goal:** To bridge the gap between Biological Sciences and AI tools (e.g., visualizing complex biological data or potential forensic applications), and/or just fun with them 😄.

🛠️ **Tech Stack & Learning Journey**
* **Core:** Molecular Biology & Genetics, Microbiology and Plant Biotechnology 🌱 Research Methodology
* **AI Tools:** ComfyUI, Automatic1111, GGUF/LoRA implementation
* **Languages:** Python (Currently learning to build custom nodes and scripts 🐍)

I can say I have hobbies in many areas. I truly love each of my hobbies, but I know it's impossible to do them all. But I know that **“*a chain is only as strong as its weakest link*”** and for that reason, I want to express my respect for all my hobbies, and I also know the importance of developing hobbies. I'm a bit of a whimsical, and I don't particularly like this characteristic, but that's the reality. I wanted to share this information in this area where I feel free, that's all.

🌱 *"Science is not about knowing the answers, it's about asking the right questions."* — This is also true for prompting!
